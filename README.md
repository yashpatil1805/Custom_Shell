# Custom_Shell
This project implements a custom shell in C that executes basic system commands and includes a count utility. Users can run commands with arguments or use count to calculate characters, words, or lines in a file. It leverages system calls like fork and execlp for process handling and supports interactive input for dynamic execution.
